                <div id="text">
                    <p>If you plan on competing in any IHSA shows, you'll need to renew your IHSA account. If you don't have an IHSA
                        account, then please refer to the last bullet on the <a href="potential.html">Potential Members</a> page.

                    <ul>
                        <li>To renew your account, you must renew your Individual Membership

                        <li>Then, you'll have to pay your annual IHSA membership fee (don't worry, this will be reimbursed!).</li>

            <h3>Van Certification</h3>
            <div>
                
                <p>For every lesson, show, or other off-site team outing, there MUST be at least one certified driver per van. 
                    Every year, many lessons need to be cancelled due to lack of certified drivers. Therefore, it's extremely important
                    that everyone who is eligible to become van certified does so.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>You are eligible to become driver certified if:</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>You have had your license for at least 2 years.</li>
                    <li>You do not have an at-fault accident on your record.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are eligible, then you can sign up to become driver certified in two steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, you must complete the 
                        <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/risk/services/university-vehicle-use/defensive-driving-course.html">
                            Defensive Driving Course.</a></li>
                    <li>Secondly, you must meet with Joyce Oakes to go over all of the rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of these steps takes only ~1 hour each, and it's absolutely essential to the operation of this team 
                    for us to have enough certified drivers, so please make sure to become certified if you're eligible! </p>
