            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h4>How can I get involved with the team?</h4>
            <p>Information on how to join our team officially can be found on the 
                <a href="potential.html">Potential Members</a> page, however you can also shoot us an email at 
                nuequestrian@gmail.com and we'd be happy to help!
            </p>
            <h4>Do I need any riding experience to join the team?</h4>
            <p>Nope! We don't hold any tryouts and we welcome riders of all levels to join!</p>
            <h4>How often does the team ride?</h4>
            <p>Our team sends out lessons on Saturday and Sunday of each week, and members are allowed to ride as frequently 
                (or infrequently) as they'd like. The exception to this is that we expect Show Team members to ride at least 
                once every two weeks, although we encourage Show Team members to ride weekly. That being said, as Northwestern 
                students we all understand that academics come first, and so if a Show Team member must occasionally skip a lesson, 
                we understand.
            </p>
            <h4>How much does is cost to be a member of the team?</h4>
            <p>Of course, horseback riding is notoriously expensive. However, we try to make our team as accessible as possible! 
                We offer two membership levels, the Riding Club and the Show Team. Individual pricing for each membership level
                 (as well as information regarding scholarships) can be found on the <a href="current.html">Current Members </a>
                 page.
            </p>
            <h4>How do we get to our lessons/competitions? Do I need to have my own car?</h4>
            <p>Northwestern allows us to use their vans to drive to and from our lessons and shows, so transportation is 
                completely free!
