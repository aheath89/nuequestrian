            <h4>How can I get involved with the team?</h4>
            <p>Information on how to join our team officially can be found on the 
                <a href="potential.html">Potential Members</a> page, however you can also shoot us an email at 
                nuequestrian@gmail.com and we'd be happy to help!
            </p>
            <h4>Do I need any riding experience to join the team?</h4>
            <p>Nope! We don't hold any tryouts and we welcome riders of all levels to join!</p>
            <h4>How often does the team ride?</h4>
            <p>Our team sends out lessons on Saturday and Sunday of each week, and members are allowed to ride as frequently 
                (or infrequently) as they'd like. The exception to this is that we expect Show Team members to ride at least 
                once every two weeks, although we encourage Show Team members to ride weekly. That being said, as Northwestern 
                students we all understand that academics come first, and so if a Show Team member must occasionally skip a lesson, 
                we understand.
            </p>
            <h4>How much does is cost to be a member of the team?</h4>
            <p>Of course, horseback riding is notoriously expensive. However, we try to make our team as accessible as possible! 
                We offer two membership levels, the Riding Club and the Show Team. Individual pricing for each membership level
                 (as well as information regarding scholarships) can be found on the <a href="current.html">Current Members </a>
                 page.
            </p>
            <h4>How do we get to our lessons/competitions? Do I need to have my own car?</h4>
            <p>Northwestern allows us to use their vans to drive to and from our lessons and shows, so transportation is 
                completely free!
            </p>
            <h4>What's the difference between the Riding Club and the Show Team? Which is better for me?</h4>
            <p>The Northwestern Equestrian Team understands that while all of our members love to ride, not everyone wants to compete.
                So, we decided to create two membership options - the Riding Club and the Show Team - so that each member of our 
                team can choose the right membership option for them. Members who are only looking to ride and are not interested in 
                competing (or members who only want to go to a couple shows) should join the Riding Club. However, members who are dedicated
                to riding frequently and attending every competition would be better off joining the Show Team. Show Team members have 
                added benefits of subsidized lessons and apparel, and so members who know that they want to ride every week and 
                attend every show will find that the Show Team is worth it for them. However, members who would prefer a more
                commitment-free riding experience will find that the Riding Club is better suited for them.
            </p>
            <h4>I have absolutely no riding experience - can I still join the Show Team?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely! The IHSA circuit has classes for every level of rider, including beginner riders! Horse showing is a great
                way for riders of all levels to gain confidence and show experience, as well as bringing the whole team closer
                together!
            </p>
            <h4>How many shows does the team attend each year?</h4>
            <p>The IHSA season is from September through March, and our team typically attends 3 shows Fall Quarter and 2-3 shows 
                Winter Quarter. There's also the post-season shows (Regionals, Zones, & Nationals) in April and May for any 
                riders who qualify!
